The two scripts here uploaded are needed to calculate microbial robusntess in a high throughput setup. 

Performance: This scripts takes as input the growth of a microorganism from a growth profiler plate and calculates the maximum specific growth rate and the lag phase. 
It also calculates biomass and product yields from concentrations measured with enzymatic assays. 
Robustness quantification: The purpose of this script is to quantify the robustness of cellular functions. Here, performance and robustness are also compared.
