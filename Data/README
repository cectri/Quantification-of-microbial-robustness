This folder contains data regarding the growth and the performance of each Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. Data regarding plate setup for growth and enzymatic assays are also uploaded. 
The files here uploaded are necessary to better understand and facilitate the use of the scripts found in the scripts/folder.

CENPK7D_summary, ETRED_summary, PE2_summary: information regarding final OD, sugars and product concentrations
CENPK7D_phenotype, ETRED_phenotype, PE2_phenotype: cellular functions calculated with the performance script in each well-growth condition
plate_legend_ACS: information regarding the growth profiler plate setup
sugar_initial_concentrtaion: initial concentration of sugars in the growth profiler plate
