# Quantification-of-microbial-robustness
The tools contained in this repository are used to calculate the robustness of cellular functions starting from the growth of different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in a microtiter plate. The scripts are available in the "scripts" folder and can be used with the data available in the "data" folder.

The purpose of this study is summarized in this manuscript: [insert link bioRxiv]
