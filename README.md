# Quantification-of-microbial-robustness
R scripts and data for quantifying microbial robustness

This repository contains the tools to calculate the robustness of cellular functions starting from the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a microtiter plate. 
The scripts are available in the "scripts" folder and can be used with the data available in the "data" folder.

The purpose of this study is summarized in this manuscript: [insert link bioRxiv]
